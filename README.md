# OllamCCLI
OllamaCCLI is a Custom Command Line Interface built for fun. It serves as a practical custom command line tool to work with the Ollama application using the Llama3 model. The customization comes from certain args available here that are not on Ollama. 


# Future Plans
- implement model switching/ selection
- list useable models 
- def need a script that starts ollama / changes models? when running?
