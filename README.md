# OllamCCLI
OllamaCCLI is a Custom Command Line Interface built for fun. It serves as a practical custom command line tool to work with the Ollama application using the Llama3 model. The customization comes from certain args available here that are not on Ollama. 


# Future Plans
- implement model switching/ selection
- list useable models 

# notes: 
- yes the .env file should be on this repo, taking some liberty here and using it store a list of Models the user is able to use. yes the api will give you a list, but I thought this was a cool way to do it
- def need a script that starts ollama / changes models? when running?
